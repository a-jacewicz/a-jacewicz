## Hi, I'm Aleks ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Senior at Wesleyan University, studying Computer Science <br>
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software Engineer and Machine Learning & Privacy Enthusiast <br>

I am passionate about software engineering, innovation, and persuing a position in the tech sector. My goals are to contribute to meaningful projects that have a large impact and pursue a career that combines my interests and talents. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech Fellow for Google and a Software Engineer at privacy-tech-lab!) <br>

ðŸ›  I am currently focusing on building a classifier that can identify phishing sites at launch time using clustering machine learning techniques as part of my senior thesis and on running a usability study for the political ad classifiers built as part of the The Cross-Platform Election Advertising Transparency Initiative (CREATIVE) project. Check out the code I've written for my thesis [https://gitlab.com/ajacewicz/similarity_phish_detect]. <br>

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills through full time work begining after graduation in May 2025. I am hoping to contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals. If you are interested in connecting or have any opportunities to discuss, please feel free to reach out! <br>
