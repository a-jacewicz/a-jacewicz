## Hi, I'm Aleks ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Recent grad from Wesleyan University, majored in Computer Science with a minor on Economics <br>
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Tech Professional and Machine Learning & Privacy Enthusiast <br>

I am passionate about coding, innovation, and persuing a position in the tech sector. My goals are to contribute to meaningful projects that have a large impact and pursue a career that combines my interests and talents. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as an AI fellow for Google and a Software Engineer at [privacy-tech-lab](https://privacytechlab.org/)!) <br>

ðŸ›  Some recent projects I worked on were building a classifier that can identify phishing sites at launch time using clustering machine learning techniques and on running a usability study for the political ad classifiers built as part of the The Cross-Platform Election Advertising Transparency Initiative (CREATIVE) project. Check out the code I've written for the phishing project [here](https://gitlab.com/ajacewicz/similarity_phish_detect). <br>

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills through full time work opportunities. I am hoping to contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals. If you are interested in connecting or have any opportunities to discuss, please feel free to reach out! <br>
